## Will be able to see how to quickly utilize 


## To Do 
- Create basic routes
- Utilize redux class to pull complex queries 

## Basic Queries
##### snippet: basicQuery to see all methods 
- all basic queries can be activated by creating variable and passing in names of table and connection 
```
let features = new Query("features", connection) 
```
## Make sure that all the basic stuff is here, then push. You can then develop each component safely. 


Start
    - Start ui
    - planning more extensively
    - think about join queries
Stop
    - be too detail oriented
Continue
    - join queries but don't get too stuck on it, 
## Standard way of fetching data from api 


This will be utilized for every independent component
